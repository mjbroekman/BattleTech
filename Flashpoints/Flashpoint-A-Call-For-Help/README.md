# Flashpoint: "A Call For Help"
This is a Flashpoint for HBS BATTLETECH 1.3 and later. It requires the ModTek, Flashpoint Stock Photos, and ExtendedConversations mods.

### Description:
    "On arriving in orbit, Yang receives a faint, but urgent call for help from one of his past MechTechs.
    Until recently, Taryn "Tweak" Wells-Karlsen was the chief tech of Faulkner Freelancers, a small
    mercenary outfit like your own. Unfortunately, the Freelancers are no more and Tweak, Yang's friend,
    now finds herself stranded and hunted by hostile forces.

    Will you help Yang's friend? Or stay out of her troubles?"

"A Call For Help" has been designed to challenge midgame level companies. It's built against multiple Lances of custom 'Mechs and veteran pilots able to run multiple engagements without repair.

### Features:
* A fully featured Flashpoint with two to three, 4+ skull missions.
* Custom edited missions with a mix of bespoke and procedural Lances.
* Two simgame conversations featuring special dialogue for the right commander traits.
* Custom Holoscreen imagery and cast.
* Events dealing with the impact of the missions on the Argo and the crew.

### Notes:
Once this Flashpoint is associated with a save file, it must be present to load that save. This is like adding new modded 'Mechs or equipment in that it becomes required to load going forward.

### Instructions:
1. Install ModTek
2. Install Flashpoint Stock Photos
3. Install ExtendedConversations
4. Copy the "Flashpoint-A-Call-For-Help" folder in to Mods folder created for ModTek.

### Required Mods:
This mod needs ModTek to work:

* ModTek - https://github.com/BattletechModders/ModTek/releases
  * This allows loading of mods in to HBS BATTLETECH.
* Flashpoint Stock Photos - https://github.com/BattletechModders/Flashpoint-Stock-Photos/releases
  * This provides some of the basic imagery used in this Flashpoint's conversations.
* Extended Conversations - https://github.com/CWolfs/ExtendedConversations/releases
  * This provides additional conversation actions used in this Flashpoint's conversations.
