    "Description" : "Faulkner's Freelancers are far from an elite mercenary unit. Run by Captain Oscar Faulkner, the Freelancers are the prototypical ragtag mercenary outfit. Pulling in just enough to keep the unit running and keeping the pilots in line through bribery and extortion, the unit's sole bright spot is their mech techs. Taryn Wells-Karlsen, or Tweak, is the unit's second-in-command and, along with her techs, likely the sole reason that the unit is able to field twelve BattleMechs and half a dozen medium and heavy vehicles.",
