# Flashpoints
These are Flashpoints that I'm working on.

- [ ] [A Call For Help](Flashpoint-A-Call-For-Help) - WIP

# Ideas in the pipeline
These are random ideas that I'm thinking about for Flashpoints after I've gotten ACfH complete:

- My Kingdom for a Drink
  - Martian-biome world needs a merc company to raid nearby systems for water / ice
  - Mission ideas:
    - Initially: Recovery -> Escort mission linked
    - Then: Escort -> Defend Base on the martian world
    - Repeat two or three times
    - Then Attack/Defend on martian world as neighbors come for revenge
- MMM/IPL Revamped mini-campaign
